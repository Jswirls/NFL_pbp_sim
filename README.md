# NFL_pbp_sim (WIP)
Notebook that contains all data/models for a play by play simulator for a NFL game
Models can be broken down into 2 main categories, pre-play, in-play and post-play
Pre-play models detemine if a given play will be a pass/run/punt/fg etc.
In-play models determine what the actual result of the play will be (yardage, completion, TD, turnover etc.)
Post-play determines if how much time has run off the clock, if a team should call a time out etc.

WIP (Currently being worked on)
1. More robust defensive stats for simulation (Individual players)
2. Multiple models for play simulation for possibly better perfomance.

Not currently implemented (Ideally will be at some point)
1. Penalties
2. Injuries
3. Simulate multiple games/entire season
